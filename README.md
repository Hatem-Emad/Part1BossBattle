This is the Boss Battle at the end of part 1 of book "The C# player's Guide (fifth edition)"
Part 1: The Basics
Introduces the core concepts of programming and covers:
  - Variables and data types  
  - Console input/output  
  - Math operations  
  - Decision making (if, switch)  
  - Loops (while, for, do-while)  
  - Methods and parameters  

I have really enjoyed it!
